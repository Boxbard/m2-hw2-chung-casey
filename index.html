    <h1>Hello! My name is Casey</h1>
    <img src="images/IMG_0414.JPG" alt="picture of an east asian girl. That's me." style="width:128px;height:128px;">
    <p>I'm a 25 year old Taiwanese American living in Central Florida. Here's some of the things I love doing!</p>
    <h2>My hobbies include...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Drawing</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Playing videogames</li>
        <li>Tech</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ok, that last one is a little vague I admit. It's a little hard to summarize just because I tend to jump around a
        lot. The short of it is that I enjoy fiddling with electronic hardware. I built my own PC, I soldered my own
        keyboard, I've taken apart my game controllers to fix them myself, and I've coded my own controllers using a <a
            href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/965">Circuit Playground</a> and <a
            href="https://makecode.adafruit.com">Makecode</a>. I really enjoy interfacing with programs and games in
        weird and unexpected ways.
    </p>

    <h2>My career goals</h2>
    <p>Right now I'm working at my local college in the Digital Media department! I'm heavily considering going into
        teaching, but I would also like to put myself out there and do more digital media work.</p>
    <p>I tend to be a jack-of-all trades, I practice graphic design, video editing, and interactive/web design at the
        college, and plus I've picked up on a few management skills from working on various teams both at my job and
        working on my degrees.</p>
    <p>There's a lot I want to do! At the end of the day, I want a job that I can care about and enjoy, while also
        pushing me to be the very best that I can be. Good pay, good benefits, and good people are my biggest
        motivators.</p>
